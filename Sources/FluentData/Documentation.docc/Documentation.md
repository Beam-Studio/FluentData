# Getting started with FluentData

Add managed persistence to your SwiftUI app using the Fluent ORM.

## Overview

Combining Fluent's proven ORM technology and Swift's modern concurrency features, FluentData enables you to add persistence to your app quickly, with minimal
code. Inspired by SwiftData, FluentData gives additional control and features over data persistence in your SwiftUI app.

Browsing the [Fluent](https://docs.vapor.codes/fluent/overview/) documentation will prove to be useful as well, since FluentData relies on this library.
